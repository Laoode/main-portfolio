This book helped me understand my previous misconceptions about goals. 
One of my favorite quotes from the book is "The secret to getting results that last is to never stop 
making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop." The key to success is 
not reaching a goal or crossing a finish line - it is having a system for improvement, an endless process of refinement. 
Furthermore, if you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. This concept 
has changed my habits and perspective, and I now strive to improve at least 1% each day.
