As a team leader, I led our team in creating a chatbot application with a clean UI using Flet and integrating the OpenAI API. This project was part of our final capstone in the Object Oriented Programming course. In my role as Project Lead & Developer, I managed our team to collaboratively develop the chatbot application using the Flet Python framework. With my experience using this framework, I was able to guide my team members in learning and developing together. Our goal was to explore and implement OpenAI API capabilities into an application with a beautiful user interface.

The Agora-AI Chatbot showcases our collective efforts in building a user-friendly
application that combines the principles of object-oriented programming with the
versatility of Python, Flet, and OpenAI. This project not only allowed us to apply
our theoretical knowledge but also fostered collaboration, problem-solving skills,
and an appreciation for the boundless potential of technology in enhancing humanmachine interactions.

<h4 align='left'>What is Flet?</h4>
<p align='left'>Without any prior experience with front-end development, this framework enables us to create a cross-platform application that functions on the web, desktop, and mobile devices. Compared to other front-end frameworks, Flet is significantly distinct. Furthermore, it is more than just a library or module for an already-existing framework. It was created from the ground up and leverages Flutter to produce elegant and polished user interfaces.</p>


<h3 align="left">Installation:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    In this project, we're using the OpenAI API. You can find your OpenAI API key at 
    <a href='https://platform.openai.com/api-keys'>API keys</a>. To get started with OpenAI API in Python, first install it using pip:
</p>



```bash
pip install openai
```
After installation, create a file called main.py and call the module using:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
```

Don't forget to set up your API key:
```python
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Oh, and we also need to install Flet! Just like any other Python package, you can install Flet using this command:

```bash
pip install flet
```

After installing Flet, call the module in main.py using:

```
import flet as ft
from flet import *
```

Now you can start exploring and creating your app using the OpenAI API!

> [!Note]
> In this project, we're just using Flet as our backend+frontend and OpenAI API to handle chat responses. We're not using any database here - you might notice in the video there's a sign-in UI, but that's just to showcase Flet's package features.

If you want to develop this further, you can integrate Firebase as a database to make your chatbot app more functional and useful!
